# skin_cancer_detection

In recent years, the incidence of skin cancer has been on the rise globally, making early detection and diagnosis more crucial than ever.
Leveraging the advancements in machine learning and mobile technology,
this project aims to develop an innovative, user-friendly Flutter application capable of detecting skin cancer from images.


# Objectives:
Develop a Mobile Application: Create a cross-platform mobile application using Flutter, providing a seamless and intuitive user experience for both Android and iOS users.
Implement Machine Learning Model: Integrate a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model for skin cancer detection into the Flutter application.
User-Friendly Interface: Design an interface that allows users to capture or upload images of skin lesions and receive immediate diagnostic feedback.
Educational Component: Provide users with information about different types of skin cancer, risk factors, and preventive measures.
Data Privacy and Security: Ensure that user data, including images and personal information, are handled with the utmost confidentiality and security.
